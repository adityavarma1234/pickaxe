# 3.1 Objects and Attributes

* Attributes are the visible facets of an object that you let the outside world to interact with.
* One way of doing this is to write accessor methods

```ruby
class BookInStock
  def initialize(isbn, price)
    @isbn = isbn
    @price = price
  end

  def isbn
    @isbn       
  end

  def price
    @price
  end
end

b1 = BookInStock.new("isbn1", 1.234)
puts "ISBN: #{book.isbn}" # => ISBN: isbn1
puts "ISBN: #{book.price}" # => ISBN: 1.234
```
* Writing accessor methods is common so ruby provides accessor methods.

```ruby
class BookInStock
  
  attr_reader :isbn, :price

  def initialize(isbn, price)
    @isbn = isbn
    @price = price
  end
end

book = BookInStock.new("isbn1", 12.34)
puts "ISBN: #{book.isbn}" # => ISBN: isbn1
puts "Price: #{book.price}" # => Price: 12.34
```
  We can think of :isbn as meaning the `name` isbn and think of plain `isbn` as meaning the value of the variable isbn.
  The accessor methods isbn and price correspond to the instance variables @isbn and @price respectively.

* Ruby decouples accessor methods and instance variables, when we declare accessor methods there is not need to declare instance variables they pop into existence when we use the accessor method.

### Writable Attributes

* Some times we need to set or manipulate the attributes outside the object. We do this by creating methods whose names end with an equal sign.

```ruby
class BookInStock

  attr_reader :isbn, :price

  def initialize(isbn, price)
    @isbn = isbn
    @price = price
  end

  def price=(new_price)
    @price = new_price
  end

end

book = BookInStock.new("isbn1", 33.80)
puts "ISBN = #{book.isbn}"
puts "Price = #{book.price}"
book.price = book.price * 0.75 # discount
puts "New price book.price"

```

* `attr_writer` is used when we need only a writer method but not a reader method. `attr_reader` is used for accessing the attribute value. `attr_accessor` is used for both read and write.

```ruby
class BookInStock
  
  attr_reader :isbn
  attr_accessor :price

  def initialize(isbn, price)
    @isbn = isbn
    @price = Float(price)
  end
end

book = BookInStock.new("isbn1", 2.03)
puts "ISBN #{book.isbn}"
puts "price #{book.price}"
book.price = book.price * 0.75  # discount price
puts "New price = #{book.price}"
```
