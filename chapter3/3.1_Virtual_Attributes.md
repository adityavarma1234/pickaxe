# Virtual Attributes

* If we want to access the price as number in cents rather than in dollars we can use some thing like

```ruby
class BookInStock
  
  attr_accessor :price
  attr_reader :isbn

  def initialize(isbn, price)
    @isbn = isbn
    @price = price
  end

  def price_in_cents
    Integer(price*100 + 0.5)
  end
end

book = BookInStock.new("isbn1", 33.80)
puts "Price = #{book.price}" #=> 33.80
puts "Price in cents = #{book.price_in_cents}" #=> 3380

```

* User `BigDecimal` not `Float` in financial calculations due to error in calculations.

* We can even assign values to our virtual attributes, mapping the value to the instance variable internally.

```ruby
class BookInStock
  
  attr_reader :isbn
  attr_accessor :price

  def initialize(isbn, price)
    @isbn = isbn
    @price = price
  end

  def price_in_cents
    Integer(price*100 + 0.5)
  end

  def price_in_cents=(cents)
    @price = cents / 100.0
  end
end

book = BookInStock.new("isbn1", 33.80)
puts "Price = #{book.price}"                       # => 33.80
puts "Price in cents = #{book.price_in_cents}"     # => 3380
book.price_in_cents = 12.34                   
puts "Price = #{book.price}"                       # => 12.34
puts "Price in cents = #{book.price_in_cents}"     # => 1234
```

* The above method is called uniform access principle. We are shielding the rest of the world from the actual implementation by using just one instance variable. We can have changes in future with out changing a lot of source code.
