# 3.3 Access Control

* Make sure people are not dependent on your class implementation but on the logic level implementation
* Never expose method that can leave an object in an invalid state.

* Public methods => any one can access. All methods are public by default except initialize which is **always** private.

* Protected methods => can only be invoked by objects of the defining class and sub classes. Access is kept with in the family.

* Private methods => Methods can be called only in the context of the current object, cannont invoke private methods of other object from one object.

* Difference between protected and private methods is that if a method is protected it may be called by `any` instance of the defining class or its subclasses. 

* If a method is private it may only be called within the context of the calling object - it is never possible to access another objects private methods directly, even if the object is of the same class as the caller. 

* Access control is determined dynamically not statically. We will get an access violation only when the code attempts to execute the restrictive method.

#### Specifying Access controls

```ruby
class MyClass

  def method1   # default is public
    # ..
  end

  protected     # subsequent methods will be protected
  def method2   # will be protected
    # ..
  end

  public        # subsequent methods will be public
  def method4   # so this will be public
   # ..
  end
end
```

* Alternate way to set access controls

```ruby

  class MyClass
    def method1
    end
    def method2
    end
    # .... so on

    public :method1, :method4
    protected :method2
    private :method3
  end

```

```ruby

class Account
  attr_accessor :balance
  def initialize(balance)
    @balance = balance
  end
end

class Transaction 

  def initialize(account_a, account_b)
    @account_a = account_a
    @account_b = account_b
  end

private

  def debit(account, amount)   
    account.balance -= amount
  end

  def credit(account, amount)
    account.balance  += amount
  end

public
  
  def transfer(amount)
    debit(@account_a, amount)
    credit(@account_b, amount)
  end
end

savings = Account.new(100)
checking = Account.new(200)

trans = Transaction.new(checking, saving)
tran.transfer(50)

```

* Protected access is used when objects need to access the internal state of other objects of the same class.

```ruby
class Account
  
  attr_reader :cleared_balance   # accessor method 'cleared balance
  protected   :cleared_balance   # but make it protected

  def greater_balance_than?(other)
    @cleared_balance > other.cleared_balance
  end
end

# Because cleared balance is protected it is only available in account objects.

```
