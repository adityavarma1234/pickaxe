# 3.4 Variables

* Variables are not objects they are just reference to objects.

```ruby

person = "Tim"
puts "The object in 'person' is a #{person.class}"
puts "The object has an id of #{person.object_id}"
puts "And a value of #{person}"

person1 = "Tim"
person2 = person1
person2[0] = "J"

puts person1     # prints Jim
puts person2     # prints Jim as person1 and person2 refer to the same object
```

* Assignment `aliases` object potentially giving you multiple variables referencing the same object. Dup method of string creates a new string with identical contents.

```ruby

person1 = "Tim"
person2 = person1.dup
person[0] = "J"
puts "person1 is #{person1}"   # => puts Tim
puts "person2 is #{person2}"   # => puts Jim

```

* We can prevent any one from changing an object by using the freeze method

```ruby

person1 = "Tim"
person2 = person1
person1.freeze    # prevents modification of the object
person2[0] = "J"  # raises an exception

```
