# 2.7 Blocks and Iterators
* Code blocks, which are chunks of code that can be associated with method invocations, almost as if they were parameters.
```Incredibly powerful feature```. 
* Code blocks are better than anonymous classes of java and pointers of C.
* Codeblocks are just chunks of code written between braces or between `do` and `end`. This is a code block
    ```ruby
    { puts "Hello" }
    ```  
  This is also a code block 
    
    ```ruby
    do 
      club.enroll(person)
      person.socialize
    end
    ```
* Use ruby braces for single-line blocks and do-end for multiple line blocks.
    
    ```ruby
    greet { puts "hi" }
    ```
* If the method has parameter they appear before the block
    ```ruby
    verbose_greet("Dave, "loyal customer") { puts "hi" }
    ```
* A method can then use the `yield` statement to invoke the associated `block` one or more times.
* Example of function using two yields
    
    ```ruby
    def call_block
      puts "Start of method"
      yield 
      yield
      puts "End of method"
    end
    call_block { puts "In block" }
    ```
* We can provide arguments to the call to the yield and they will be passed to the block. With in the block you list the names of the parameters to receive these arguments between vertical bars(|params|).
 
> Think of block and methods as coroutines, which transfer control back and forth between themselves.

  ```ruby
    def who_says_what
      yield("Dave", "hello")
      yield("Andy", "good bye")
    end
    who_says_what { |person, phrase| puts "#{person} says #{phrase}" } 
  ```
* Codeblocks are used through out the ruby library to implement `iterators`, which are __methods that return successive elements__ from some kind of _collection_, such as an array.
    
    ```ruby
    animals = %w( ant bee cat dog ) # create an array
    animals.each { |animal| puts animal } # iterate over the contents

    ['cat', 'dog', 'horse'].each { |name| prints name, " " }
    5.times { print "*" }
    3.upto(6) { |i| print i }
    ('a'..'e').each { |char| print char }
    ```
