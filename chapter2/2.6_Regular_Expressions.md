# 2.6 Regular Expressions
* Regular experssion is simply a way of specifying a __pattern of characters__ to be _matched_ in a string.

* In ruby a regular expression is typically created by writting a pattern between slash characters.
```ruby 
/pattern/
```
* Regular expressions are objects and __can be manipulated__ as everything in ruby is an object.
* 
```ruby
/Perl|Python/
``` 
Matches the string for either Perl or Python.

* The forward slashed _delimit_ the pattern.
* The | -> pipe character means either the thing on the right or the thing on the left. 
* Repetion matches
```ruby
/ab+c/
```
matches a string containing a followed by one or more b's, followed by a c.
* 
```ruby 
/ab*c/
``` 
matches one a zero or more b's, and one c.
* We can also match __one of group of characters__
like
```ruby
\s
```
matches a _whitespace_ character such as (__space, tab, newline__, and so on)
```ruby
\d
```
which matches any ```digit```.
```ruby
\w 
```
which matches __any character__ that may appear in a typical word.
A dot (.) matches __almost any character__.

* Some useful regular experssions
    ```ruby
    /\d\d:\d\d:\d\d/     # a time such as 12:34:56
    /Perl.*Python/       # Perl, zero or more other chars, then Python. 
    /Perl Python/        # Perl, a space, and Python
    /Perl *Python/       # Perl zero or more spaces and Python
    /Perl +Python/       # Perl one or more spaces and Python
    /Perl\s+Python/      # Perl, white space characters, then python
    /Ruby (Perl|Python)/ # Ruby, a space and either Perl or Python.
    ```

* The match operator 
```ruby 
=~ 
```
can be used to __match a string against a regular expression__. If the position is found in the string it return the start position other wise it returns 
```ruby 
nil
```
.
* So regular expressions can be used as _conditions_ in if and while statements as they return start position or 
```ruby
nil
```

    ```ruby
        line = gets
        if line =~ /Perl|Python/
          puts "Scripting language mentioned: #{line}"
        end
    ```
* Using substitution methods we can replace the part of string that has been matched.

  ```ruby
    line = gets
    newline = line.sub(/Perl/, 'Ruby') # Replace first Perl with Ruby
    newerline = newline.gsub(/Python/, 'Ruby') # Replace every Python with Ruby.
  ```
* We can replace every perl or python with ruby using

    ```ruby
    line = gets
    newline = line.gsub(/Perl|Python/, 'Ruby')
    ```
