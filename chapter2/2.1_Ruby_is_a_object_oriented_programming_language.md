# 2.1 Ruby is an object oriented programming Language  
 * In ruby every thing is an __Object__.
 * Object is an __instance__ of a class.
 * You create objects by calling a __constructor__, special method of a class. Standard constructor is  called ```new```. 
 * ```Question: Then what is initialize?```
   ```sh
   song1 = Song.new("Ruby Tuesday")
   song2 = Song.new("Enveloped in Python")
   ```

* Every object has a unique identifier object, ```Object ID```.
* __Instance variables__ are variables which are _unique_ to each instance or object.
* Instance methods are methods that can be defined inside a class and can be called in the context the class, depending upon accessibility constraints from outside the class like private & protected.

* The ```state``` of the object is stored in the __instance variables__ and instance methods have access to the instance variables

* Methods are invoked by sending a 1``message``` to an object.
  ```sh
  puts "gin joint".length
  puts "Rick".index("c")
  puts 42.even?
  puts sam.play(song)
  ```
* Each line above shows a method being called as an argument to puts?
* ``` Not sure about what the above statement means?```
* The thing before the period is called the __receiver__ and the name after the method is the method to be invoked.    
  Receiver is basically an object and method an instance method of it.

##### Difference between ruby and other languages is 
* In languages like JAVA lets say to find the absolute value of a number we call a seperate function and pass the number.
  ```sh
  num = Math.abs(num)
  ```
* In Ruby, the ability to determine the absolute number is builtin into the numbers. Basically they a ```number is an object``` of Fixnum class and you can call various instance methods on it of which abs is one.  
  ```sh
  num = -1234
  positive = num.abs
  ```
 * In C we write 
 * ```sh 
    strlen(name)
  ```
* In ruby we write ```name.length```
* So ruby is a genuine **programming language**.
