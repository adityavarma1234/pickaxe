# 2.3 Arrays and Hashes
*  Arrays and hashes are indexed collections.  
* Arrays are indexed using integers and hashes can be indexed using any object as a key. 
  Array and Hash can hold objects of differing types. 
* Not like int arr[] in c in which all the array elements must be integers.
* In ruby an array can contain different objects of different types  

  ```ruby
  a = [1, "a string", ["an array", "of string"]] 
  ```
  
* An array literal is a set of elements between square brackets. We can initialize an array using an array literal.
Ruby array indices start at zero. 
  
  ```ruby
  a = [1, 'cat', 3.14]
  puts "the first element is #{a[0]}"
  a[2] = nil
  puts "the array is not #{a.inspect}"
  ```
  
* In ruby ```nil``` is an object just like any other object it just represents nothing.
* Creating array of words can be ```painful``` some time as follows with all the quotes and commas
  
  ```ruby
  a = [ 'ant', 'bee', 'cat', 'dog', 'elk']
  a[0]
  a[3] 
  ```
  
* Ruby has a shortcut **%w** just for such cases
  
  ```ruby
  a = %w{ ant bee cat dog elk }
  ```
  
* Hashes have keys and values. Keys must be unique in hashes. For example.
    
    ```ruby
    inst_sellection = {
      'cello' => 'string',
      'clarinet' => 'woodwind',
      'drum' => 'percussion',
      'oboe' => 'woodwind',
      'trumpet' => 'brass',
      'violin' => 'string'
    }
    ```
    
* The thing before the => (_hash rocket_) are called __keys__ and after => are called __values__.
* A unique value of oboe is only valid as ```keys must be unique``` like indices in the array
* Keys and values can be arbitary objects.
    
    ```ruby
    p inst_selectoin['drum']
    p inst_selection['cello']
    p inst_selection['basson']
    ```
    
* A hash by default returns nil when a key it does not contain is being accessed.
* We can override the default nil by doing the following consider the case when we want to calculate the count of words.
    
    ```ruby
    histogram = Hash.new(0)
    histogram['ruby'] # => 0 
    histogram['ruby'] = histogram['ruby'] + 1
    histogram['ruby'] # => 1
    ```
