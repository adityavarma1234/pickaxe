# 2.4 Symbols

```ruby
    NORTH = 1
    EAST = 2
    SOUTH = 3
    WEST = 4
    walk(NORTh)
    walk(EAST)
```
* Symbols are simply constant names that you don't have to predeclare and that are __guaranteed to be unique__.
Symbols are a colon followed by some name.
    
    ```ruby
    walk(:north)
    look(:east)
    ```
* No need to assign a value to a symbol. Ruby guarantees that the symbol value __will be unique no matter where you write it in the program__.

    ```ruby
    def walk(direction)
      if direction == :north
        # ..
      end
    end
    ```
* Symbols are frequenty used as keys in hashes. We can write the previous example as below.
    ```ruby
    inst_selection = {
      :cello => 'string',
      :clarinet => 'woodwind',
      :drum => 'percussion',
      :oboe => 'woodwind',
      :trumpet => 'brass',
      :violin => 'string'
    }
    
    inst_section[:oboe]  # => woodwind
    inst_section[:cello] # => string
    # strings are not same as symbols
    inst_section['oboe'] # => "woodwind"
    ```

* Short cut syntax for hash name: value
    ```ruby
    inst_section = {
      cello: 'string',
      clarinet: 'woodwind',
      drum: 'percussion',
      oboe: 'woodwind',
      trumpet: 'brass',
      violin: 'string'
    }
    
    puts "An oboe is a #{inst_section[:oboe]} instrument"
    ```
