# 2.4 Symbols

NORTH = 1
EAST = 2
SOUTH = 3
WEST = 4

walk(NORTh)
walk(EAST)

Symbols are simply constant names that you don't have to predeclare and that are guaranteed to be unique.
A colon followed by some name.

walk(:north)
look(:east)

No need to assign a value to a symbol. Ruby guarantees that the symbol value will be unique no matter where you write it in the program.

def walk(direction)
  if direction == :north
    # ..
  end
end

Symbols are frequenty used as keys in hashes. We can write the previous example as below.

inst_selection = {
  :cello => 'string',
  :clarinet => 'woodwind',
  :drum => 'percussion',
  :oboe => 'woodwind',
  :trumpet => 'brass',
  :violin => 'string'
}

inst_section[:oboe]  # => woodwind
inst_section[:cello] # => string
# strings are not same as symbols
inst_section['oboe'] # => "woodwind"


Short cut syntax for hash name: value

inst_section = {
  cello: 'string',
  clarinet: 'woodwind',
  drum: 'percussion',
  oboe: 'woodwind',
  trumpet: 'brass',
  violin: 'string'
}

puts "An oboe is a #{inst_section[:oboe]} instrument"
