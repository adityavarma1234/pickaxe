# 2.5 Control Structures

* Ruby uses **end** to signify the end of a block of key word for __if__ statements and **while** loops.
    ```ruby
    today = Time.now
    
    if today.saturday?
      puts "Do chores around the house"
    elsif today.sunday?
      puts "Relax"
    else
      puts "Goto work"
    end
    ```

* While statements are terminated with end as well.
    ```ruby
    num_pallets = 0
    weight      = 0
    
    while weight < 100 and num_pallets <= 5
      pallet = next_pallet()
      weight += pallet.weight
      num_pallets += 1
    end
    ```
* Consider the code
   
   ```ruby
    while line = gets
      puts line.downcase
    end
    ```
    
* The above works as almost all statements in ruby returns the last value it executes so it returns the standard input stream or the end of input
* Ruby __statement modifiers__ are useful if body of an if or while statement is just a single expression.
    
    ```ruby
    if radiation > 3000
      puts "Danger, Will Robinson"
    end
    ```
    
* Using a __statment modifier__,
    
    ```ruby
    puts "Danger, Will Robinson" if radiation > 3000
    ```
    
* Similarly for while loop.
    
    ```ruby
    square = 4
    while square < 1000
      square = square*square
    end
    ```
    
* concise version of it 
    
    ```ruby
    square = 4
    square = square * square  while square < 1000
    ```
