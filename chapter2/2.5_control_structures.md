# 2.5 Control Structures

Ruby uses end to signify the end of a block of key word for if statements and while loops.

today = Time.now

if today.saturday?
  puts "Do chores around the house"
elsif today.sunday?
  puts "Relax"
else
  puts "Goto work"
end

While statements are terminated with end as well.

num_pallets = 0
weight      = 0

while weight < 100 and num_pallets <= 5
  pallet = next_pallet()
  weight += pallet.weight
  num_pallets += 1
end

Consider the code

while line = gets
  puts line.downcase
end

The above works as almost all statements in ruby returns the last value it executes so it returns the standard input stream or the end of input


Ruby statement modifiers are useful if body of an if or while statement is just a single expression.

if radiation > 3000
  puts "Danger, Will Robinson"
end

Using a statment modifier,

puts "Danger, Will Robinson" if radiation > 3000

Similarly for while loop.

square = 4
while square < 1000
  square = square*square
end

concise version of it 

square = 4
square = square * square  while square < 1000
