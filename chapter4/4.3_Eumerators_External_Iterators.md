# Enumerators External Iterators.

* One area where iterators fail badly is where you need to treat an iterator as an object in its own right (for example, passing the iterator into a method that needs to access each of the values returned by that iterator). It is also difficult to iterate over two collections in parallel using rubys internal iterator scheme. Ruby comes with built in enumerator class, which implements external iterators in ruby just for such occasions.

```ruby

a = [1, 3, 'cat']
h = { dog: 'canine', fox: 'vulpine' }

enum_a = a.to_enum
enum_h = h.to_enum

enum_a.next # => 1
enum_h.next # => [:dog => 'canine']
enum_a.next # => 3
enum_h.next # => [:fox => 'vulpine']

```
* Most of the internal iterator methods the ones that normally yield successive values to a block will also return an enumerator object if called without a block.

```ruby
a = [1, 3, 'cat']

enum_a = a.each  # Create an enumerator using an internal iterator
enum_a.next  # => 1
enum_a.next  # => 3

```

* Ruby has method called `loop` that does nothing but repeatedly invoke its block. When an enumerator object runs out of values inside a loop, the loop will terminate cleanly. 

```ruby

short_enum = [1,2,3].to_enum
long_enum = ('a'..'z').to_enum

loop do 
  puts "#{short_enum.next} - #{long_enum.next}"
end

produces:
1 - a
2 - b
3 - c

```
