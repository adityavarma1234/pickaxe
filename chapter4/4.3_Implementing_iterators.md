# Implementing Iterators

* A ruby iterator is simply a method that can invoke a block of code.

```ruby

def two_times
  yield
  yield
end
two_times { puts "Hello" }

produces:
Hello
Hello
```

* We can pass parameters to the block and receive values from them.

```ruby

def fib_up_to(max)
  i1, i2 = 1, 1
  while i1 <= max
    yield i1
    i1, i2 = i2, i1 + i2        
  end
end

fib_up_to(1000) {|f| print f, " " }

produces
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987
```
* Some iterators are common to many types of Ruby collections. Let's look at three: each, collect, and find.

  * each is the simplest iterator - all it does is yield successive elements of its collection.

  ```ruby
  
  [1, 3, 5, 7, 9].each {|i| puts i}
   
  produces:
  1
  3
  5
  7
  9
  ```
* A block may also return a value to the method. The value of the last expression evaluated in the block is passed back to the method as the value of the yield.

```ruby

class Array
 
 def find
   each do |value|
     return value if yield(value)
   end
 end

end

[1, 3, 5, 7, 9].find {|v| v*v > 30} # => 7

```
* collect also known as map takes elements from the collection and passes it to the block, the result returned by the block are used to construct a new array.

```ruby

["H", "A", "L"].collect { |x| x.succ }  # => ["I", "B", "M"]

```

* Iterators are not limited to accesss elements in arrays and Hashes. An iterator can return derived values.

```ruby

f = File.open("testfile")
f.each do |line|
  puts "The line is: #{line}"
end
f.close

```

* Some times we want to count the number of times you have been through a block.

```ruby 

f = File.open("testfile")
f.each.with_index do |line, index|
  puts "Line #{index} is: #{line}"
end
f.close

```

* Inject method lets you accumulate a value across the members of a collection.

```ruby

[1,3,5,7].inject(0) {|sum,element| sum+element}           # => 16
[1,3,5,7].inject(1) {|product,element| product*element}   # => 105

```

* Initial value sum is 0, element is 1 and then sum is 1 and element is 3 and so on  
  Initial value product is 1, element is 1 and then product is 1 and element is 3 and so on .
  If no parameter is passed to inject then it uses the first element of the collection as the initial value and starts the iteration with the second value.

  ```ruby
  
  [1,3,5,7].inject {|sum,element| sum+element}     # => 16
  [1,3,5,7].inject {|product,element| product*element} # => 105

  ```

* We can also do something like below which works because ruby addition and multiplication are simply methods on numbers.

  ```ruby
  
  [1,3,5,7].inject(:+)   # => 16
  [1,3,5,7].inject(:*)   # => 105

  ```
