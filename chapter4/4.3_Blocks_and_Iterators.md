# 4.3 Blocks and Iterators

```ruby
for i in 0..4
  word = top_five[i][0]
  count = top_five[i][1]
  puts "#{word}: #{count}"
end

# instead of above we could have written for the previous case

top_five.each do |word, count|
  puts "#{word}: #{count}"
end

# we can write it even more compact like this

puts top_five.map { |word, count| "#{word}: #{count}" }
```

### Blocks

* A block is a chunk of code enclosed between either braces or do and end. Current best practices use braces when single and do, end when spanning multiple lines.

```ruby

some_array.each { |value| puts value*3 }

sum = 0
other_array.each do |value|
  sum += value
  puts value/sum
end

```

* Blocks can appear in code only after the `invocation` of some method. If the method takes parameters, the block appears after the parameters.

```ruby
sum = 0
[1, 2, 3, 4].each do |value|
  square = value*value
  sum   += square
end
puts sum
```
