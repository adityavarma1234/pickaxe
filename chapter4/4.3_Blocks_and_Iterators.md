# 4.3 Blocks and Iterators

```ruby
for i in 0..4
  word = top_five[i][0]
  count = top_five[i][1]
  puts "#{word}: #{count}"
end

# instead of above we could have written for the previous case

top_five.each do |word, count|
  puts "#{word}: #{count}"
end

# we can write it even more compact like this

puts top_five.map { |word, count| "#{word}: #{count}" }
```

### Blocks

* A block is a chunk of code enclosed between either braces or do and end. Current best practices use braces when single and do, end when spanning multiple lines.

```ruby

some_array.each { |value| puts value*3 }

sum = 0
other_array.each do |value|
  sum += value
  puts value/sum
end

```

* Blocks can appear in code only after the `invocation` of some method. If the method takes parameters, the block appears after the parameters.

```ruby
sum = 0
[1, 2, 3, 4].each do |value|
  square = value*value
  sum   += square
end
puts sum
# prints 30
```
* One important principle that is happening in the above code is that, `if there is a variable with the same name as a variable in the same scope outside the block, the two are the same`. There is only one variable sum in the preceding program.  

* If a variable appears only inside a block then that variable is local to the block. IN below code we cannot write square at the end of the code, because square is not defined at that point. It is defined only inside the block itself.

```ruby
square = Shape.new(sides: 4)

sum = 0

[1, 2, 3, 4].each do |value|
  square = value * value
  sum += square
end

puts sum

square.draw  # BOOM!
```

* The above square which had the square object is being over ridden by the time the each method returns.


* Way to avoid the above scenario.

  * First, parameters to a block are always local to a block, even if they have the same name as locals in the surrounding scope. 

  ```ruby
    
    value = "some shape"
    [1, 2].each {|value| puts value}
    puts value

    produces:
    1
    2
    some shape
  ```

  * Second we can define block local variables by putting them after a semicolon in the blocks parameter list. So the above squares example we could have done something like this.

  ```ruby
 
    square = "some shape"

    [1, 2, 3, 4].each do |value; square|
      square = value * value # this is a different variable
      sum += square
    end

    puts sum
    puts square

    produces:
    30
    some shape
  ```
