# 6.1 Numbers

* Class Fixnum range is -2^62 && 2^62-1

* Class Bignum numbers outside above range

```ruby

num = 10001

4.times do 
  puts "#{num.class}: #{num}"
  num *= num
end

```
* For large numbers `_` are used instead of commas for readability which are ignored by ruby.

* Rational and complex numbers in ruby.

```ruby

Rational(3, 4)* Rational(2, 3)  # => (1/2)
Rational("3/4")*Rational("2/3") # => (1/2)

Complex(1, 2)*Complex(3,4)      # => (-5 + 10i)
Complex("1+2i")*Complex("3+4i") # => (-5 + 10i)

```

* Numbers interact for operations between integer and float will result in float. Most general number will be the result like integer + complex = complex.

* Looping using numbers.

```ruby

3.times { print "X" }
1.upto(5) {|i| print i, " "}
99.downto(95){|i| print i," "}
50.step(80,5) {|i| print i, " "}
10.downto(7).with_index {|num,index| puts "#{index}: #{num}"}

```
